# example_programs_in_C

This repository contains small programs in C, that I have written to test different things.

You can check also the companion repository of example programs in [D](https://dlang.org/), my favouirte language that has many things in common with C and also with Python.

In case that you want to clone this repository, use

  git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/pdenapo/example_programs_in_C.git
  
since my repository uses [submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).
